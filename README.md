●	Identify: Manage security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 

●	Protect: Develop a strategy to protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 

●	Detect: Scan for potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 

●	Respond: Ensure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize and analyze security incidents and implement improvements to the security process. 

●	Recover: Return affected systems back to normal operation and restore systems data and assets that have been affected by an incident.
